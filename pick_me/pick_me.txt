Dear Hiring Manager,

  Greetings, my name is Charles Ren. After attending monthly Ruby OC meetings with Forrest Chang, I am continuously inspired 
by his approach to software methodology and his still burning passion for Rails architecture. It was through our talks that 
I was introduced to the idea of being a software craftsman and striving to improve in this skill. He showed me the teachings 
of Uncle Bob’s design principles, understanding of the Blub Paradox from Paul Graham, and issues of technical debt by Ward Cunningham. 
And that doesn’t even include the two books on TDD & Extreme Programming by Kent Beck. These meetings are more than just learning sessions; 
they’re a gateway to a deeper understanding and appreciation of software craftsmanship, something I eagerly anticipate each time, 
and that gives me assurance that I would fit in very well within your company, since these same values fit in perfectly with my own ideals.

  In the spring of sophomore year of college, I tried to find a career shift from healthcare to software engineering.
Despite a summer internship at a local hospital, I had accepted that the fastest way to a career change was to graduate a year early 
and throw myself into coding. I self-taught full-stack JavaScript and after a year, I decided that I wanted a more focused education. 
This led me to the Backend Program at Turing School of Software & Design, where I discovered the elegance of Ruby and completed several 
Ruby on Rails projects in the last eight months, many of them in a pair or team setting. Through these team-based projects, 
I’ve come to understand that teamwork is essential to combining diverse skill sets in a collaborative environment - 
enhancing pair-programming and problem-solving abilities. 

  These projects not only honed my coding skills but also underscored the importance of teamwork in software engineering. 
Reflecting on my initial journey in healthcare, where a physician advised me to prioritize good management over solely financial gain, 
I find a strong similarity with my experience in software development. This advice, emphasizing the pursuit of guidance and mentorship, 
has profoundly influenced my career path. My time with Forrest has only reinforced this belief, instilling a deep conviction in his vision of 
dedicated software craftsmanship. I am eager to bring my passion and learned skills to Hedgeye, where I can contribute to and grow 
within an environment that values both personal development and the continuous pursuit of technical excellence. 

  I look forward to speaking with you soon, I can be reached anytime by phone or email. 

Warmest regards,
Charles Ren

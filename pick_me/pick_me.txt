Why Charles Ren?

After attending monthly Ruby OC meetings with Forrest, I am continuously inspired by his approach to software methodology 
and his still burning passion for Rails architecture. It was through our talks that I was introduced to the idea of being 
a software craftsman and striving to improve in this skill. He showed me the teachings of Uncle Bob’s design principles, 
understanding of the blub paradox from Paul Graham, and issues of technical debt by Ward Cunningham. And that doesn’t even 
include the two books on TDD & Extreme Programming by Kent Beck. These meetings are more than just learning sessions; 
they’re a gateway to a deeper understanding and appreciation of software craftsmanship, something I eagerly anticipate each time. 

In the spring of sophomore year of college, I tried to find a career shift from healthcare to software engineering. 
Despite a summer internship at a local hospital, I had accepted the fastest way to a career change was to graduate a year early 
and throw myself into coding. Post graduation, I self-taught full-stack JavaScript, and after a year, I decided I wanted 
a more focused education. This led me to the Backend Program at Turing School of Software & Design, where I discovered 
the elegance of Ruby and completed several Ruby on Rails projects in the last eight months.

Project Highlights:

Little Esty Shop Project:
- Crafted an e-commerce platform in Ruby on Rails for inventory, invoice, and transaction management for merchants and admins.

- Created merchant dashboard features for item management and customer invoice processing with real-time revenue tracking.
- Integrated extensive admin functionalities for overseeing merchants, sales statistics, and platform-wide transactions.
- Enhanced user experience and code organization through advanced routing and namespacing.

  Key Achievement:
    - Integrated a bulk discount feature, enabling merchants to apply discounts based on item quantities and refine the dashboard 
    for discount management, including advanced calculations for optimal discount application in customer invoices.

Adopt Don’t Shop Project:
- Engineered a Ruby on Rails pet adoption web application with PostgreSQL.
- Introduced advanced Rails search functionalities for pets, using ActiveRecord for partial and case-insensitive searches.
- Applied MVC architecture for effective code organization, including form validations and user feedback through flash messages.
- Designed a user-friendly interface for pet adoption and admin approval, utilizing Rails partials for simplified views.
- Ensured robust application performance using 'capybara' and 'rspec-rails' for comprehensive testing.
